â˜†Charactersâ˜†<br /><br />

Remi - The Tsundere Oni<br /><br />
Remi is one of the last remaining members of a clan of Oni and came to the human world to fight the monsters you accidentally released. Sheâ€™s a little terse at first, but once you get to know her, you realize she has a much softer side. However, it seems that you bear a striking resemblance to someone that she fell in love with in the past...<br /><br />

Megumi - The Proud Oni<br /><br />
Megumi was raised alongside Remi and trusts her deeply when it comes to fighting monsters. Sheâ€™s a proud warrior and has the skills to match, but she can be a little too confident at times. If youâ€™re able to prove your worthiness as a fighter, she might just show you a different side to herself.<br /><br />

Shizuku - The Childhood Friend<br /><br />
Kind-hearted and mild-mannered, Shizuku has been your friend as long as you can remember. While she doesnâ€™t have any special powers, she does her best to help you and the two Oni fight off the monsters! Rumor has it that sheâ€™s got a thing for you.</p>
