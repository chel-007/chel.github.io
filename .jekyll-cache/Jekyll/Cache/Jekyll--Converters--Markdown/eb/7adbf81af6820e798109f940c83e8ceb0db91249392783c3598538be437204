â˜†Charactersâ˜†<br /><br />

The Cute Classmate - Kana<br /><br />

Kana sits next to you in class and can be a little shy at times, but is a curious soul with a tendency to get herself caught up in trouble. Sheâ€™s also a surprisingly talented witch whose magical abilities will definitely prove useful.<br /><br />

The Tsundere Class President - Haruna<br /><br />

Considered the â€œclass mom,â€ Haruna is hugely popular among the other students and even has her own fan club. Though she can be very blunt, thereâ€™s a much kinder side to her that you might just get to see if youâ€™re lucky enough.<br /><br />

The Mature Student Council Head - Mai<br /><br />

Mai is one of the first people to find out you canâ€™t use magic and helps you fake your magic abilities. Sheâ€™s mature for her age and always seems to keep a level head, but sheâ€™s also very interested in unlocking the secrets of the school...</p>
