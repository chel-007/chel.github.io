When scientists found a way to anthropomorphize animals, the world changed forever. Now dubbed “anthros,” these new creations live alongside humans—but a strict caste system keeps the two groups apart.

You’ve always been sympathetic toward anthros and believe they deserve equal rights, but you’re afraid to speak out against popular opinion.

That changes when one of your anthro classmates tries to kill herself because of the way people treat her. Something has to change, both for her and for the anthro community overall.

With the help of your best friend and an enthusiastic classmate, you vow to help her build more self-confidence… and maybe change the way society views anthros along the way.

Characters

* [Shy Anthro] Christa
Lacking confidence because she’s an anthro, Christa prefers to stay out of the public eye, but she isn’t happy with her life. Can you help her emerge from her shell and prove herself to the world?

* [Best Friend] Zoe
Popular and outgoing, Zoe has been your best friend ever since you were children. What most people don’t know is that she’s an anthro passing as human—a secret the two of you carefully guard..<br>MOD:No ruby consume for Premium choices.<br><b class="downloadlinks">DOWNLOAD LINK:<button type="button" class="btn btn-success" onclick="window.location.href = 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oCtsYEkjIKvv2_U7Bch9HaH2lBaXWLuN/view?usp=drivesdk';">DOWNLOAD</button></b></li><br>
